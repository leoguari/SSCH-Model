\section{Introduction}
This is a summary report of the outputs of the Systems Science for Caribbean Health diabetes model for Jamaica. 
\\
\\
We model  different scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a base case scenario with no interventions or changes to prevent obesity, diabetes or mortality due to diabetes;
  \item interventions focused exclusively on the food system and diet including taxes, increased fruit and vegetable production, and public awareness campaigns;
  \item interventions focused on increasing physical activity including infrastructure for active transport, public awareness campaigns, and changes to bus fares;
  \item health system interventions targeted at those at high risk of progressing to diabetes, and a reduction in mortality due to diabetes;
  \item a combined up upstream approach;
  \item and a combined upstream and health systems approach.
\end{enumerate}

The primary outcome of interest is diabetes prevalence, but the report will also track diabetes mortality, obesity prevalence, and estimates for diabetes incidence.

\newpage
\section{Business as usual - no interventions}
The outputs presented here are an estimate of major indicators of the diabetes epidemic in adults (20+ years) in Jamaica from 1990 to 2050.
